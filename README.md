Whispers Beneath The Darkness - A Python & OpenGL exploration game built with Python and OpenGL, using glPoints, the Midpoint Line Algorithm, and the Midpoint Circle Algorithm. The game focuses on minimalistic visuals, creating an eerie and atmospheric experience where the environment evolves as the player uncovers key story fragments.

Chapter 1 - The City of Echoes where the protagonist explores a decaying city filled with hidden memories. As the player discovers key fragments, the environment begins to change, reflecting the protagonist's journey and unraveling the city’s tragic past.

Key Discoveries:

"Flickers of Dread": Streetlights flicker back to life, illuminating dark corners. "The flame that once lit the streets now flickers in the hearts of the lost."
"Shards of Silence": The city grows eerily silent, symbolizing dark, forgotten pacts. "In the shadows of stone, a pact was made."
"Glimmers of Fear": Ghostly lights emerge as new fears and regrets surface. "Salvation is never without its price."
As each fragment is found, street lamps light up, cars change color, and trees begin to green — signifying life returning in pockets, even as the city remains cursed.

Chapter 1 Highlights:

Exploration: The city feels alive, even in its abandonment, with streets becoming subtly illuminated as the protagonist uncovers fragments.
Dynamic Environment: As the player discovers new memory fragments, the city responds — street lamps flicker back on, cars take on eerie, colored glows, and even the trees begin to regreen.
Truth Unfold: Each object or fragment found reveals more about the tragic history of the city, bringing the player deeper into its cursed past.

What’s Next?

Chapter 1 is just the beginning.
